# Game Info
SAG is a HTML5 web-based multiplayer game using Phaser3.  In the multiplayer mode, the player will enter a game lobby waiting for other players to join, and the room owner can start the game regardless of whether there are 4 players or not. In a count down of 5, the game will start, and each player will try to destroy all enemy towers while protecting their own tower in order to win. Players can drag different units to the map to help them, and fight for the center sword for strong ability. The player character can respawn when their healthpoint is below 0, but they will lose the game if their towers are destroyed. Try to be the last player standing! See tutorial page of the game for more details. Our goal of the project is to create an easy-accessed web-based game using what we learned, and can be enjoyed by a small group of peoples.
